# MSB-FW.rs
Mechanical Sensor Board Firmware in Rust (experimental, not for usage on car)


### Commands

First, [get rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

Second, clone and open this root folder.

To build `msb-fw-rs`, just run `cargo build --release`.  Note the first time you do this it will take a while, as `rustup` has to install the correct version of rust for this project.

To deploy onto an embedded chip locally connected, run `cargo run --release`.

To build a different project other than `msb-fw-rs` (of which none exist), cd into that directory and run build.

To format, run `cargo format`. 

To lint and check stuff, run `cargo clippy`.

###  On car stuff

To run a RTT terminal dedicated:
`cargo embed --release --config rtt`

To run a GDB terminal dedicated:
`cargo embed --release --config gdb`

To flash and leave code:
`cargo embed --release --config `



### Coding tips and tricks

- Use defmt macros to print stuff

### Repository structure

This is a mega-repo configured as a normal embassy-styled project with multiple dependency crates and sub-projects.

Various files:

Top level `Cargo.toml`, `Embed.toml`, and `rust-toolchain.toml` define the various parts of the embassy project.  See comments inside for how these were structure, but most follow embassy specification.

The `crates` folder defines drivers or other code shared between projects.

Top level folders like `msb-fw-rs`, and any other project, define projects which inherit explicity defined `Cargo.toml` dependencies and `Embed.toml` settings, and more.  They can also depend on a crate in the `crates` folder.

This structure has multiple benefits, including:
- Static versioning of all embassy and other dependencies, eliminating version conflicts for in-tree code
- Inherited build settings so like-microcontroller projects share all of that boilerplate
- Shared `target` folder meaning a shared build cache for quicker and space-saving builds
- Other quirks, such as vscode `settings.json` and `config.toml`, are shared between projects
